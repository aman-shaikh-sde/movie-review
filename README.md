Movie Review Platform


Movie Review Backend Application
üìå Project Description

The Movie Review Backend Application is a RESTful API built using Spring Boot.
It allows users to:

Add and manage movies

Post reviews for movies

Fetch reviews and ratings

Search for movies

This backend is designed for scalability and can serve as the foundation for a full-stack movie review platform.

üìù Assumptions & Design Choices

Framework: Spring Boot was chosen for rapid development and REST API support.

Database: MySQL is the primary database; H2 is used for testing.

Entity Relationships:

A Movie can have multiple Reviews.

Each Review is linked to a User.

Security: For simplicity, authentication is not implemented in this version (can be added later using Spring Security + JWT).

Error Handling: Custom exceptions and @ControllerAdvice are used for clean error responses.
